### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Robin.
 - I'm a husband to a beautiful wife and a father of 2 wonderful children
 - I'm an Office 365 Architect and as such most of what I work on revolves around that and a lot of PowerShell. 
 - Outside of PowerShell my langauge of choice is C#, however I also use JavaScript in some of my projects
 - I work on Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr and occasionally Sonarr in my spare time.
