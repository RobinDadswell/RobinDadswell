### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Robin.
 - I'm currently learning JavaScript and improving my C# knowledge. 
 - I'm a husband to a beautiful wife and a father of 2 wonderful children
 - I'm an Office 365 Architect and as such most of what I work on revolves around that and a lot of PowerShell. 
 - I am always looking to learn new things and am currently doing that through contributing to Sonarr and Radarr.
